# Proctoring SDK with Face Detection and Media Stream Uploading

This repository contains a **Proctoring SDK** that allows:
- Capturing **camera**, **microphone**, and **screen share** streams.
- Real-time **face detection** using **TensorFlow.js BlazeFace**.
- Streaming and **uploading** media streams to a server for analysis and storage.

## Features

- **Camera, Microphone, and Screen Sharing**: Capture video, audio, and screen streams.
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Detect faces from the camera stream using BlazeFace.
- **Proctoring Setup**: Control when to start and stop media streams and face detection.
- **Stream Uploading**: Send media streams (video, audio, screen) to a server for storage and analysis.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/proctoring-sdk.git
cd proctoring-sdk
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies using **npm** or **yarn**:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Using the SDK

### Importing the Proctoring SDK

The SDK provides functions to set up the camera, microphone, screen sharing, and face detection. Use the alias `@/lib` to import the SDK components in your project.

```typescript
import { Proctor } from '@/lib';
```

### Starting Proctoring

To start capturing the camera, microphone, and screen sharing, and run face detection:

```typescript
Proctor.setup({
  onVideoFrame: (cameraStream: MediaStream) => {
    // Handle the camera stream (e.g., attach to a video element)
  },
  videoElement: videoRef.current,  // The video element for face detection
  canvasElement: canvasRef.current,  // The canvas element to draw face boxes
  onAudioStream: (audioStream: MediaStream) => {
    // Handle the audio stream
  },
  onScreenStream: (screenStream: MediaStream) => {
    // Handle the screen sharing stream
  },
  onTabSwitch: () => {
    // Handle tab switch detection
    alert('You switched tabs! Please return to the test.');
  }
});
```

### Stopping Proctoring

To stop all active streams and face detection:

```typescript
Proctor.stopCamera();
Proctor.stopMicrophone();
Proctor.stopScreenShare();
```

## Face Detection

This SDK uses **TensorFlow.js BlazeFace** for real-time face detection. The face detection model is loaded automatically when the camera stream starts. The results (face bounding boxes) are drawn on a canvas overlay.

### How It Works

1. The **BlazeFace** model is loaded and used to detect faces in real-time from the camera feed.
2. Face bounding boxes are drawn on a canvas overlaid on the video stream.

### Key Code for Face Detection

Face detection is set up when the camera stream is initialized:

```typescript
import { FaceDetection } from '@/lib/faceDetection';

Proctor.setup({
  onVideoFrame: (cameraStream: MediaStream) => {
    // Attach the camera stream to the video element and start face detection
    FaceDetection.detectFaces(videoRef.current, canvasRef.current);
  },
  videoElement: videoRef.current,  // The video element for face detection
  canvasElement: canvasRef.current  // The canvas element to draw face boxes
});
```

---

## Uploading Streams to Server

The SDK includes a `StreamUploader` class that allows you to capture and upload the media streams (camera, microphone, and screen) to a server for analysis and storage.

### How to Use the StreamUploader

```typescript
import { StreamUploader } from '@/lib/streamUploader';

// Initialize the uploader
const uploader = new StreamUploader({
  videoStream: cameraStream,
  audioStream: audioStream,
  screenStream: screenStream,
  serverUrl: 'https://your-server-url/upload'  // Server endpoint to upload streams
});

// Start uploading the streams
uploader.start();
```

### Server-Side Example (Express.js)

The following is an example of an Express.js server to handle media uploads:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    const uploadDir = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads');
    if (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {
      fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir);
    }
    cb(null, uploadDir);
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, file.originalname);
  }
});

const upload = multer({ storage });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  console.log(`File uploaded: ${req.file.originalname}`);
  res.status(200).send('File uploaded successfully.');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
